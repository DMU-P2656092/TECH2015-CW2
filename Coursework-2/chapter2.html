                <p>Following the crash landing of the Separatist Command Ship on the planet surface of Coruscant, both the Jedi and the Chancellor make their way
                    to the Galactic Senate building. When they arrive, the key members of the Jedi Council are waiting, along with some members of the Galactic Senate.
                    Jedi Grand Master Windu and Yoda are the first to approach the Chancellor and ask about his current well-being.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The chancellor describes the recent events of how Count Dooku was defeated thanks to his Jedi rescuers and that General Grievous has once again
                    escaped capture. Master Windu reassures the Chancellor that nothing else could be done. Going on to say that running and hiding is what Grievous always does,
                    claiming, "he's a <em>coward</em>".</p>

                <br>
                <p>After the Chancellor, Master Windu and Yoda, followed by the other Senators, have continued on into the Senate Chambers, Anakin speaks with Bail Organa,
                    the senator of Alderaan. They talk about the war efforts and how much has changed since the first day of conflict on Geonosis all those years ago, as well
                    as what it will take for the war to end. Anakin explains that there will never be an end to the war until Grievous is, "spare parts".</p>
                <br>
                <p>Seeing his wife, Senator Padme Amidala of Naboo, standing hidden behind one of the entrance pillars, he apologises to Senator Organa and makes his way over
                    to his wife. They embrace tightly. She explains that she had heard stories that he had been killed whilst away on missions, but Anakin promptly calms her and
                    reassures her that he's alright. However, Anakin notices that his wife is not herself. He realises that she's trembling and asks her what is wrong. Padme pauses,
                    lets out a sigh, and informs him that she is pregnant and that he is going to be a father.</p> 
                <br>
                <p> Padme explains that she is worried about what they are going to do. If the Jedi Council found out about their relationship, Anakin would be banished from the Jedi Order,
                    and her reputation as a senator would be tarnished. Before she continues to spiral and panic, Anakin takes hold of Padme by her shoulders and shows happiness about the pregnancy
                    and comforts her, affirming that their child is a blessing.</p>
