                <p>Anakin goes to the Chancellor's office to inform him of the news that Obi-Wan has found General Grievous and has begun the battle.
                    But as Anakin explains how he should be there with him, given their past of always being together on missions, Chancellor Palpatine begins to
                    manipulate Anakin. He tells him that the Council doesn't trust Anakin and he has such potential that the Order prevents him from reaching.
                    Palpatine continues to explain how he can teach Anakin the ways of the force and that his master before him taught him everything about
                    the light and the dark side of the force.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Now hearing that Palpatine knows how to use the dark side of the force, Anakin changes his tone from upset to concerned. He is intrigued as to why
                    Palpatine learned both sides of the force. But when Chancellor Palpatine claims that only through him and his teachings he could save his wife Padme
                    from death from childbirth, Anakin figures out that Palpatine is the Sith Lord that the Jedi had been looking for. The one who is behind the war
                    and the leader of the Sith Order.</p>

                <p>After making the discovery of the Sith Lord's identity, Anakin tells Palpatine that he is going to turn him into the Jedi Order and have him arrested. He promptly leaves Palpatine's
                    office and finds Master Windu. He sees that Master Windu is leaving the Jedi Temple and finds out that Grievous has been killed. Master Windu believes that the war is now over,
                    but when Anakin informs him that this may not be the case, Windu is intrigued. Anakin continues on to tell him about his conversation with Chancellor Palpatine and how he knows
                    the ways of the force and has been trained to use the dark side.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Master Windu now believes that Palpatine is the Sith Lord using the concerns he previously had and with the new evidence from Anakin. Being concerned by Anakin's state of mind and 
                    relationship with the Chancellor, he warns Anakin to stay away and allow the Jedi Council to sort this matter. Master Windu attempts to reassure Anakin that he trusts him and that 
                    he must wait in the council chambers until his return.</p>
