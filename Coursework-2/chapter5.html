                <p>With the information provided by Anakin Skywalker, Master Windu, along with Kit Fisto, Agen Kolar, and Saesee Tiin, went to confront the Chancellor
                    about him being the Sith lord. With their lightsabers drawn, they demand Palpatine surrender to be arrested. However, Palpatine stands from his chair
                    and draws his lightsaber. Using the force to help his withered body, he lunges at the Jedi and kills all but Master Windu in one swift movement. The pair
                    clash lightsabers and make advances on each other. Neither side can get a hit.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Eventually, the fight leads back to Palpatine's office. But this time, Master Windu has the advantage. Palpatine is pushed to the floor, and his lightsaber
                    is thrown out of the window. Anakin comes running into the office before Windu gives the killing blow. Palpatine gives it one last chance to manipulate Anakin,
                    saying that the Jedi have taken over the Senate and the act of trying to arrest him is proof.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As Master Windu is about to kill Palpatine, Anakin claims that he needs Palpatine alive to save his wife. Windu ignores this remark and continues to attack.
                    In a split-second decision, Anakin draws his lightsaber and attacks Windu, severing his hand and making his lightsaber fly out the window. With the chance to 
                    attack present again, Palpatine unleashes force lightning on Master Windu and kills him.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Anakin is distraught over what he has done and drops to his knees in shock. Palpatine, now regaining his strength, gets to his feet and coerces Anakin to embrace
                    the dark side of the force. He gives Anakin a new name. Darth Vader. Anakin is given a new mission, to exterminate the rest of the Jedi order within the temple as
                    Palpatine sends out the secret code to all clones across the galaxy. The code "<em>Execute Order 66</em>" is given to all clones to turn against the Jedi in an effort
                    to wipe them out. </p>

                <p>The new Sith Lord, Darth Vader, leads the attack on the Jedi Temple. The 501st Legion followed him into the Temple to help exterminate the Jedi Order. No one is spared.
                    Those in the archives, the Jedi Knights from missions, and even the Jedi Younglings are slaughtered at Darth Vader's hands. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Across the galaxy, clones turn against their masters. Jedi such as Ki' Aldi Mundi, Aylaa Secura, and Plo Koon are all slaughtered by their own company of clones.</p>
