               <p>News reached the Jedi Council of the possible whereabouts of General Grievous. Reports said that a heavy force of Separatist forces landed on the subterranean 
                planet of Utapau and that Grievous may be hiding in the craters occupied by the natives. Disputes over who should go find Grievous occurred between the council members,
                with Anakin suggesting the idea of him leading the mission at the request of the Chancellor. But because of the suspicious activity of the Chancellor interfering
                with Jedi affairs, they denied the notion. Instead, deciding that Master Obi-Wan Kenobi should go and lead the campaign.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Whilst Obi-Wan is boarding the Venator class Star Destroyer that is carrying his 212th Battalion for the assault on Utapau, Anakin arrives to say goodbye. Anakin explains
                that he wants to apologise for recent his actions of being insubordinate, reckless, and arrogant. Obi-Wan responds by saying how proud he is of Anakin and that he has trained him
                the best that he could, adding that Anakin is a much better Jedi than Obi-Wan could ever hope to be. The pair say their goodbyes and go their separate ways.</p>

               <!-- br tag used to set clear paragraphs within the cell. -->
               <br>
               <p>After infiltrating the planet and informing his soldiers that General Grievous is indeed hiding on Utapau and holding the natives hostage, Obi-Wan decides to
                confront Grievous head-on. Acquiring an animal from one of the holding bays as silent transport, he makes his way towards the landing platform where Grievous is.
                Obi-Wan watches from a ceiling beam Grievous informing the other high-ranking members of the Separatist army of their new orders of moving all commanding operations 
                to the lava planet Mustafar.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Seeing his opportunity to attack, Obi-Wan makes the descent to the ground and exclaims, "Hello there!" Capturing the attention of all those in the room, Grievous
                gets into a fighting stance by opening up his other two hidden arms to allow him to hold four lightsabers at a time. Obi-Wan gets into position and waits for the first attack.
                Before any major blows could be made, the 212th Battalion engages the rest of the droid army on Utapau.</p> 
               <br>
               <p>With the fighting happening everywhere and the droid army being weakened, General Grievous gets worried and tries to make an escape. Running from the landing platform,
                through the streets and to his private hanger, Grievous attempts to get into his bomber starfighter. But before he could do so, Obi-Wan catches up to him and begins his
                second attack. Due to losing his lightsaber earlier in the battle, he has no choice but to fight the metal cyborg in hand-to-hand combat. Grievous taunts Obi-Wan by throwing
                him around, but Obi-Wan makes every hit count. He tears open the chest cavity revealing the vital organs. After being thrown off the platform, Obi-Wan hangs from the ledge.
                Using his last piece of strength, Obi-wan uses the force to pull a nearby blaster and begins firing at Grievous' chest. The heat from the blaster bolt sets Grievous' organs on fire
                just before he explodes. Seeing the leader of the Separatist army dead on the floor, Obi-Wan makes his way back to his soldiers to rejoin the fight, but before he leaves, he makes
                a remark about the blaster, calling it "so <em>uncivilised</em>", referring to him being accustomed to the lightsaber.</p>
