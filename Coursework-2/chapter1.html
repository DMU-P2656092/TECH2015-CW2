            <br>
            <p>With instructions from the Jedi Council that Chancellor Palpatine has been captured by Separatist forces, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi
                and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker join the battle over the planet surface of Coruscant. The clone army is attempting to defend the homeworld of the
                Galactic Republic, whilst the Jedi attempt to penetrate the Separatist blockade; they do their best to help weaken enemy forces.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During the fight towards the Separatist Command Ship, the Jedi are targeted by Vulture Droids and Buzz Droids. Through diligent planning
                and co-operation, they are able to defeat their attackers and continue to make their way to their destination. With the destruction of the hanger
                force fields, the Jedi make their way into the enemy hanger and land their starfighters. Their search for the Chancellor begins.</p>

            <!-- br tag to set clear paragraphs within the cell. -->
            <br>
            <p>After locating the Chancellor aboard the Command Ship, the two Jedi are confronted with the head of the Separatist government, the Sith Lord Count Dooku.
                He approaches the Jedi and asks them to draw their swords. The fight begins. With a backwards and forwards fight, and interruptions by Dooku's personal
                Super Battle Droids, it is unclear who would win the duel.</p>
            <br>
            <p>At a spot of weakness, Dooku uses the force to push Obi-Wan across the room to knock him out, and then tries to crush him under a platform which Dooku tears down
                on top of him. With Anakin's emotions coming into the fight, he is left alone to end the battle. Dooku begins to taunt Anakin and tempts him to use his emotions, stating,
                "I sense much fear in you, <em>Skywalker</em>, you have hate, you have anger, but you don't use them".</p>
            <br>
            <p>Anakin is able to combat these taunts and eventually disarms Dooku by severing his hands and bringing him to his knees. With the conflict building inside him, with the
                decision to either kill Dooku or keep him alive as a prisoner, he pauses. The Chancellor sees this and tells him to kill Dooku. Despite Anakin's reservations on the action
                due to the teachings of the Jedi Order, he cuts off Dooku's head. Once he shows displeasure for his own actions, he runs to Obi-Wan to save his life before escaping.</p>

            <!-- br tage used for clear paragraphs within the cell. -->
            <br>
            <p>In the process of escaping the Command Ship, the Jedi and the Chancellor are imprisoned in ray shields. It seems they were caught in a trap set by General Grievous, the leader of
                the Separatist army. They become surrounded by droids and are brought to the bridge of the ship, where the General is waiting for them. When the Jedi are escorted to the bridge, they
                are met by the General, who proceeds to disarm them and add their lightsabers to his collection within his robes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A brief conversation occurs between the Jedi and the General, which results in Obi-Wan claiming that the General won't escape this time, unlike their previous encounters. A signal is given
                to R2-D2, and he provides a distraction in which he breaks one of the Jedi's restraints. Using the force to take back their weapons, both of the Jedi are freed and begin to eliminate
                the droids on the bridge. Going through the pilots, engineers, and the General's private security, they surround him. Due to Grevious being a cyborg, he breaks the glass windows of
                the bridge in an attempt to escape, in which he is pulled into the vacuum of space and makes his way to the life pods to escape.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With Grevious gone, and no pilots left in the Command Ship, the Jedi are left to bring the falling ship to the planet's surface in order to safely return the Chancellor.
                Anakin takes the helm due to being the best pilot, with R2-D2 managing the ship's systems. The ship breaks in half during the descent, and they struggle to maintain speed.
                The ship begins to heat up, and with a short communication with the planet's surface forces, clone ships are sent to help disperse the fires. The ship lands with a large crash
                and destroys some buildings whilst sliding across the runway. Once the ship comes to a halt, Obi-Wan makes a comical remark, "<em>Another happy landing</em>".</p>
