                <p>Bringing Padme aboard her ship, Obi-Wan can see that she is in a bad condition. He, along with Senator Organa and Master Yoda, brings her to the asteroid
                    Polis Massa for her to give birth. To everyone's surprise, Padme is not only carrying twins, but she is dying. The medical droid helps Padme give birth to her baby
                    boy and baby girl. She names them Luke and Leia. In her last dying breath, Padme asks Obi-Wan if Anakin is alright and tells him that, despite his recent actions,
                    she knows that there is good still within him.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To help hide the children from both Darth Vader and the Emperor, it is decided that they are separated. Senator Organa says that he will take Leia, as he and his wife
                    have always dreamed of having a baby girl of their own. Obi-Wan, on the other hand, agrees to take Luke back to Tatooine, the planet Anakin was born, to be with his family.
                    He says that he will go into hiding on the planet and watch over him to keep him safe from the Empire.</p>

                <p>Time has passed since Obi-Wan left the planet Mustafar, the Emperor can sense that something is wrong and that Darth Vader is in danger.
                    He travels to Mustafar along with some Coruscant guards to look for him. They find him by the river, where Obi-Wan left him, but to the Emperor's 
                    surprise, Darth Vader is still alive. The guards rush to find a gurney. Once Darth Vader is aboard the Imperial Shuttle, the Emperor brings
                    him back to Coruscant for surgery.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The process of saving Darth Vader is long and extremely painful, as Vader screams in agony the entire time. Prosthetics are added, and some body
                    parts are removed due to extensive burn damage. Finally, Vader's helmet is placed on his head, along with his built-in breathing apparatus. When he
                    is able to stand, Darth Vader turns to Emperor Palpatine and asks, "Where is <em>Padme</em>? Is she safe? Is she alright?" The Emperor informs him
                    that she died and that, in his anger, Vader must have killed her.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The story ends with a newly built Darth Vader, recovered from surgery, standing next to his new master. They are aboard the new Imperial-class Star 
                    Destroyer as they watch the construction of the Death Star super-weapon.</p>
